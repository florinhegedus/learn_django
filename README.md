# Learn Django
This is a repository where I try to create a project with django and to learn its ways.

## Setup
You have to create a conda environment first
```
conda create --name django
```
and then activate it
```
conda activate django
```

Install the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a django project
```
django-admin startproject cfehome
```

And now you can start your server
```
python manage.py runserver
```
